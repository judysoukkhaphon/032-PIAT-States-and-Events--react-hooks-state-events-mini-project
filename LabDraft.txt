pass down the data imported in App to other components

See console message for which data should be passed to TASK and CATEGORY

1. TaskList: display all tasks. Pass task data from App to TaskList, display each using a Task component. Use a Key prop.
	(had to assign keys, then access them by passing the keys under another propname)
2. Task: update Task component to show task's text and category. On Delete click, remove task from list.
	(wrote the function in App, which is passed through TaskList to Task, where it's called)

3. CategoryFilter: Pass list of categories to CategoryFilter from App. Update this component to display <button>'s for each category. buttons need a key prop equal to the category to pass tests.
	When a button is clicked:
		1. should have a class of "selected", while the others do not.
		2. the displayed list of tasks should be filtered by matching category that was clicked
		3. if "All" button is clicked, display all tasks

4. NewTaskForm: Pass list of categories to NewTaskForm from App. Update to display <option> elements for each category inside of a <select> element except the "All" category. Update this form to be a controlled component, so all form inputs are captured in state. onSubmit, add a new task to the list with the text and category from the form. To pass test, you'll need a prop "onTaskFormSubmit" that takes a task OBJECT as an argument.

Learned:
"key" props aren't actually passed, they are used as a reference for React.
If you need to access a "key" value, you have to pass it (again) under another prop name.

Children can only have 1 parent, so data must be passed through the parent to move to siblings.

In this lab, the component that the data is created in handles the *{state}* of that data in it's file. If another component affects the state, then a function is passed to the child, so when the child calls the function it can pass data back to the component that is actually handling the state.

Questions:
I used non-destructive operators to copy the TASKS into taskList but for some reason, when printing TASKS, the added "id" key appears there too, and not just when I print taskList.
